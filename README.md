# machineLearningInitiative
This repository keeps a weekly track of all the new concepts that I learn in my `Machine learning` coding initiative. 
I will be using `Google Collab notebooks` and Python libraries like `numpy, Pandas, matplotlib, Skilit Learn, Tensor flow, Beautiful soup` throughout the project.

The projects inside this repository is inspired by the udemy course `Machine learning A-Z` by Kirill Eremenko, Hadelin de Ponteves and team.
